# JFrog Platform Provider

The [JFrog](https://jfrog.com/) Platform provider is used to interact with the features from [JFrog Platform REST API](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-rest-apis/jfrog-platform-rest-apis). The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Links to documentation for specific resources can be found in the table of contents to the left.

This provider requires access to JFrog Platform APIs, which are only available in the _licensed_ pro and enterprise editions. You can determine which license you have by accessing the following URL `${host}/artifactory/api/system/licenses/`

You can either access it via API, or web browser - it requires admin level credentials.

```bash
curl -sL ${host}/artifactory/api/system/licenses/ | jq .
{
  "type" : "Enterprise Plus Trial",
  "validThrough" : "Jan 29, 2022",
  "licensedTo" : "JFrog Ltd"
}
```

## Authentication

The JFrog Platform provider supports one type of authentication using scoped token.

### Scoped Token

Artifactory scoped tokens may be used via the Authorization header by providing the `access_token` field to the provider block. Getting this value from the environment is supported with the `JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable

Usage:
```hcl
# Configure the Artifactory provider
provider "platform" {
  url = "my.jfrog.io"
  access_token = "abc...xy"
}
```

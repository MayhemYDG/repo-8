<h1><a id="accounts">Configuring the AWS account</a></h1>
<p>
    Accounts provide Octopus with the credentials it requires to interact with cloud platforms. In order for us to deploy to AWS, we must create an AWS account.
</p>
<p>
    AWS accounts are made up of an access and secret key. The documentation at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/">https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/</a> provides instructions for creating AWS access keys.
</p>
<p>
    To create the AWS account in Octopus, apply the Terraform configuration in the <strong>terraform/accounts/octopus</strong> directory using the following commands:
</p>
<pre>cd terraform/accounts/octopus
terraform init
terraform apply</pre>
<p>
    You will be prompted for the URL of your Octopus instance, the Octopus API key, the ID of the space to apply the configuration to, the AWS access key, and the AWS secret key. Terraform then displays a list of changes and prompts you to allow them to be applied. Once the configuration is applied you will see a new account called <strong>AWS Account</strong>:

    To verify the account is working as expected, click it, and then click the <strong>SAVE AND TEST</strong> button:

<p>
    With the account configured the next step is to configure the environments.

<h1><a id="feeds">Configuring the sample application feed</a></h1>
<p>
    This book documents the process of deploying a sample application called Octopub. Octopub implements a sample online library and is implemented as a number of microservices.
</p>
<p>
    For convenience, the services that make up Octopub have been compiled, packaged, and exposed via a public Maven repository. In this chapter we'll configure an Octopus Maven feed which we'll use in later chapters to download and deploy Octopub to AWS.
</p>
<p>
    Note that although Maven is typically associated with Java, we are not limited to deploying Java applications. Maven repositories can host arbitrary files, such as zip files. Maven feeds also have the advantage of being able to be accessed anonymously. This means the sample application can be distributed and consumed without sharing any credentials.
</p>
<p>
    To create the feed in Octopus, apply the Terraform configuration in the <strong>terraform/feeds/octopus</strong> directory using the following commands:
</p>
<pre>cd terraform/feeds/octopus
terraform init
terraform apply</pre>
<p>
    You will be prompted for the URL of your Octopus instance, the Octopus API key, and the ID of the space to apply the configuration to. Terraform then displays a list of changes and prompts you to apply them. Once the configuration is applied you will see a new feed called <strong>Sales Maven Feed</strong>:
</p>
<div><img alt="Octopus environments" src="images/octopus/mavenfeed.png"/></div>
<p>
    To verify the feed is working as expected, click it, and then click the <strong>TEST</strong> button. Enter <strong>com.octopus:frontend-webapp-static</strong> as the package name and click the <strong>SEARCH</strong> button:
</p>
<div><img alt="Octopus environments" src="images/octopus/mavenfeedsearch.png"/></div>
<p>
    With the feed configured the next step is to configure the AWS credentials used by Octopus to perform deployments.

<h1><a id="intro">Configuring the sample application feed</a></h1>
<p>
    This book documents the process of deploying a sample application called Octopub. Octopub exposes a sample online library and is implemented as a number of microservices.
</p>
<p>
    For convenience, the services that make up Octopub have been compiled, packaged, and exposed via a public Maven repository. In this chapter we'll configure an Octopus Maven feed which we'll use in later chapters to download and deploy Octopub to AWS.
</p>
<p>
    Note that although Maven is typically associated with Java, we are not limited to deploying Java applications. Maven repositories can host arbitrary files, such as zip files. Maven feeds also have the advantage of being able to be accessed anonymously. This means the sample application can be distributed and consumed without sharing any credentials.

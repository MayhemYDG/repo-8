## Deploying Lambdas with Octopus and GitOps

This book provides a guide to deploying microservice applications with Octopus to AWS Lambda, exposed by API Gateway, and with a static frontend web application hosted in S3. Octopus itself is configured with Terraform to allow each project to be quickly created while also providing a template teams can use to deploy their own Lambda applications internally. The whole process is then automated as a GitOps workflow using GitHub Actions.
